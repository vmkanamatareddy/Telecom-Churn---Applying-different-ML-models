# Telecom-Churn---Applying-different-ML-models

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months. 
Steps:

Preprocess data (convert columns to appropriate formats, handle missing values, etc.)

Conduct appropriate exploratory analysis to extract useful insights (whether directly useful for business or for eventual modelling/feature engineering).

Derive new features.

Reduce the number of variables using PCA.

Train a variety of models, tune model hyperparameters, etc. (handle class imbalance using appropriate techniques).

Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Note that is is more important to identify churners than the non-churners accurately - choose an appropriate evaluation metric which reflects this business goal.

Finally, choose a model based on some evaluation metric.
